Abstract: Interlingual communication has always been important, but
if there was ever any doubt about this, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic
has shown it to be particularly true. New information is being released
every day about travel restrictions, economic impacts, public health and
safety procedures, and potential vaccines. Barriers of language should
be removed where possible to ensure that everyone can stay up-to-date
and safe, regardless of how many speak the language. Previous work has
been carried out to aid rapid translation of COVID-19 related material
in several major languages. However, absent among the languages served
is Irish.
